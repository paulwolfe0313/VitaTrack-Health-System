## Installation and Usage

The application is used from the point of view of an Admin user at the front desk.

Upon startup, the home page will be viewed.

From here, attempting to navigate to any of the option will result in a login prompt.

You should log in with the username "Admin" and password "password".

From there the main options are: Schedule Appointment, Manage Patients, and Manage Billing.

Schedule Appointment will allow the user to choose a provider, patient, date, and time frame to schedule an appointment.

Manage Patients will allow you to view appointments for a patient or view historical records. Upon view, appointments can be selected to chart or can be cancelled.

When a Chart is submitted, a bill is automatically generated.

Manage Billing can be used to pay bills.
